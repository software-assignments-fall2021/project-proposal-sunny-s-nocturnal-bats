# lovEasy (Project Proposal)
By David Iosilevich (di492), Sunny Dhindsa (sd3692)

### What and why?
In 2021, there are an array of dating apps all with the same format: swiping through those profiles who are close to you in distance. The problem with this traditional approach, however, is that great matches for you are lost in a sea of profiles who may not be best suited for you.

* But, what if you had an app that did the work for you?
* What if the app was able to match you with great connections based on science? 

Such an app would facilitate the way such options are presented by offering a number of visual UX differences along with alternative methods of data collection. The great thing about this approach is that instead of swiping through everybody like a traditional dating app, lovEasy takes a much more calculated approach to matching you with people who you would actually be interested in. It takes much of the guesswork out of dating apps and ensures you’re dating with more purpose, without wasting your time swiping through thousands of profiles you may not be interested in.

### For whom?
For people of all ages, genders, religions, and races who wish to date with more purpose, those who are too busy or don’t want to swipe through an array of profiles, and people interested in forming connections with others based on science rather than mere physical proximity.

### How?
lovEasy asks you to fill out a survey based on your preferences/interests. Later, you can answer specific questions about yourself in hypothetical situations (“Would you rather bring X or Y to a deserted island?”) to get the perfect match. Additionally, when you’re filling out your preferences, you’ll be shown an array of faces to choose from. 

From here, the algorithm will use that information to “match” you to one person per day who we think you’d be a good fit with based on your preferences of physical and personality characteristics. Aside from matching profiles, lovEasy would improve on currently existing messaging in dating apps by implementing visual user customization preferences, such as a “dark mode” option or a chosen color scheme.

### Scope
The project would be an appropriate length for one semester as there are plenty of features which can be created or expanded upon depending on the group’s discretion. While some features are likely non-negotiable (chat features and profile creation, for example), each group can have a lot of liberty when it comes to what they decide to implement. This app is perfect for a small group for one semester as it will hopefully be an easy to use app while still being functional.
